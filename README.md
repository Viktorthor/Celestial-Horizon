# About Celestial Horizon
## Project has been abandoned due to inactivity and personal life. The script with touch controls is inactive but functional. Feel free to play the first level or add on to a project of your own.

A small Unity project made for fun for Android & iOS.

All artwork in this game is made by me.

A simple bullet hell game where you must think fast and dodge bullets while enemies fly in from every direction!
Power ups and multiple levels to be added.

## This is a work in progress and does not reflect the final project/product.


09.10.21 - Inital commit, starting new project
